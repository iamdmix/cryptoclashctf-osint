# Welcome to OSINT 101  
## How to Hack Legally (And Also How to Not Get Hacked)

---

# What is OSINT?

- Open-Source Intelligence: **Finding information that is publicly available.**
- Used by hackers and security pros, journalists, law enforcement.
- Just because it's out there doesn’t mean you should use it carelessly.

---

# In short: Being really good at ~~stalking~~ googling

# Everything You Put Online?  
## Yeah, It's Still Out There

- Old social media posts, emails, and forum comments never truly disappear.
- Your online footprint is bigger than you think.
- Data breaches? Personal info could already be exposed.

---

# And You've Probably Shared More Than You Think

- Birthday? **Check.**
- Favorite places? **Check.**
- Daily habits? **Check.**
- Now think about what someone can do with that information.

| **Legal & Ethical** | **Questionable** | **Illegal** |
|-------------------|---------------|----------|
| Google Dorking | Scraping non-sensitive data | Hacking accounts |
| WHOIS lookups | Using leaked databases | Doxxing individuals |
| Publicly available social media | Automated mass scraping | Identity theft |

# Now, Let's Get Into the OSINT Process

---

1. **Define the Objective** – What are you looking for?
2. **Identify Sources** – Google, social media, domain registries, etc.
3. **Collect Data** – Gather and organize the information.
4. **Analyze** – Find connections, patterns, and insights.
5. **Report Findings** – Summarize everything clearly.

# Tools of the Trade

| **Tool** | **Purpose** |
|---------|-------------|
| Google Dorking | Advanced search techniques |
| WHOIS Lookups | Find domain ownership info |
| SOCMINT | Social media intelligence |
| Reverse Image Search | Track image sources |
| OSINT Framework | Collection of OSINT tools |

# Bohot Theory Hogayi.  
## Let's Try This.

---

# Google Dorking:  
### Stop Searching Like a Caveman.

---

# WHOIS & Domain Lookups:  
### Who’s Behind That Website?

- Every website leaves a digital trail.
- WHOIS lets you check **ownership, registration details, and contacts.**
- Useful for identifying **fake websites, scams, and phishing attempts.**

---

# nslookup: Investigate Domains & DNS Records

- **Find domain IP addresses, mail servers, and security records.**
- Helps in **identifying phishing domains & infrastructure mapping.**

---

# Shodan

- **Google finds websites.**
- **Shodan finds exposed devices.**
- **Search for:**
  - **Unsecured security cameras**
  - **Databases without passwords**
  - **IoT devices with default logins**

---

# SOCMINT: Social Media Intelligence  
### Thanks to Oversharing, This is Too Easy

- Find usernames across platforms.
- Search old tweets, posts, and locations.
- Identify relationships and patterns in someone's digital footprint.

---

# Reverse Image & Geolocation Analysis

- **Google Reverse Image Search** → See where an image appears online.
- **EXIF Data Extraction** → Hidden metadata, like GPS and timestamps.

---
# Mission Briefing

Your mission, should you choose to accept it, is to track down **Dhyeya Anand Deshpande**.

Intel suggests he’s been especially active with **code sharing and project development**. Start there, connect the dots, and uncover the truth.
1. **Date of Birth**
2. **Hometown**
3. **Motorcycle owned**
4. **Favorite cuisine**
